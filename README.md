# hello-world
This is the classical "Hello World" programming procedure to know how to use the tool.

Hi
I'm an employee at "Secretorganization Solutions of Mexico, IT Manufacturing Solutions area, and I like to introduce myself a little, or at least trying to follow up with the tut, I like programming, computers, games and music (rock, metal, progressive metal, 80's, I hate raeggae/raeggaeton or w.e. it is spelled).

TL:DR - This is a gitHub tutorial activity.
